DATABASE DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
College Event Participation & Certificate System

1. ER DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The system consists of four main entities:

a) STUDENT
   - Attributes: student_id (PK), name, email, department, year
   - Represents a student in the college.

b) EVENT
   - Attributes: event_id (PK), title, date, organizer, venue
   - Represents an event organized by a department or club.

c) REGISTRATION
   - Attributes: reg_id (PK), registration_date, participation_status
   - Foreign Keys: student_id (-> STUDENT), event_id (-> EVENT)
   - An associative entity representing the M:N relationship between STUDENT and EVENT.
   - Status tracks if a student 'Registered', was 'Present', or 'Absent'.

d) CERTIFICATE
   - Attributes: cert_id (PK), issue_date
   - Foreign Keys: reg_id (-> REGISTRATION)
   - One-to-One relationship with REGISTRATION. 
   - A certificate is generated ONLY if participation_status is 'Present'.

Relationships:
- STUDENT <-> EVENT: Many-to-Many (Resolved by REGISTRATION)
- REGISTRATION <-> CERTIFICATE: One-to-One (Subset constraint)

2. RELATIONAL SCHEMA
--------------------
STUDENT (student_id, name, email, department, year)
Primary Key: student_id

EVENT (event_id, title, date, organizer, venue)
Primary Key: event_id

REGISTRATION (reg_id, student_id, event_id, registration_date, participation_status)
Primary Key: reg_id
Foreign Key: student_id references STUDENT(student_id)
Foreign Key: event_id references EVENT(event_id)

CERTIFICATE (cert_id, reg_id, issue_date)
Primary Key: cert_id
Foreign Key: reg_id references REGISTRATION(reg_id)

3. NORMALIZATION (UP TO 3NF)
----------------------------
1NF: All attributes are atomic (no multi-valued attributes like 'phone_numbers' stored as lists).
2NF: No partial dependency. All non-key attributes depend on the full primary key. (e.g., student name depends on student_id).
3NF: No transitive dependency. Non-key attributes depend ONLY on the primary key. (e.g., department is stored as a name directly associated with student, assuming for this scope it's an attribute of student).

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
-------------------------
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- Frontend: HTML/CSS
